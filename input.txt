When first released, Qt used its own paint engine and controls,
emulating the look of the different platforms it runs on when it drew its
widgets. This made the porting work easier because very few classes in Qt depended
really on the target platform; however, this occasionally led to slight discrepancies where
that emulation was imperfect. Recent versions of Qt use the native style APIs of the different platforms,
on platforms that have a native widget set, to query metrics and draw most controls, and do not suffer from such
issues as much. On some platforms (such as MeeGo and KDE) Qt is the native API. Some other portable graphical toolkits
have made different design decisions; for example, wxWidgets uses the toolkits of the target platform for its implementations.
